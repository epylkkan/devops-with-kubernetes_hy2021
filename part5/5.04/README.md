<h2>OpenShift</h2>

* Open Source

* Runs on RHEL

* Cost scales nicely down if your application needs less nodes

* Possibly complex to configure

* Versatile HW platform support 


<h2>Rancher</h2>

* Availability of the catalog of ready-to-run services and applications

* Web interface and the ability to launch quickly other orchestrating solutions such as Kubernetes

* Lets you streamline cluster deployment on bare metal, private clouds, public clouds or vSphere 

* Multi-cluster consistency with a single deployment.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I prefer to go with Rancher due to ready made components
