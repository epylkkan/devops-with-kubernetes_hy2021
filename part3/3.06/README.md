3.06:


1) Benefits of Cloud SQL compared to self hosted db

All data is encrypted at rest and in transit
GCP manages high availability (e.g. replication to multiple zones)
Support for standard db connectors 
A bit faster / cost effective to setup
GCP Operations Suite integrated monitoring & logging
Patching by Google
Integrated backup


2) Advantages of self managed db compated to Cloud SQL

More flexibility with the config options
Maintenance cost is probably lower especially with the small projects
Easier to keep lower level environments identical with PROD
Easier to move to another cloud provider  ... or back to on-premise :-)
Moving to another cloud provider is straightforward


3) Question marks: scaling
