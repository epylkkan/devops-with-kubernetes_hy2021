A bit faster / cost effective to setup

GCP Operations Suite integrated monitoring & logging

Patching by Google

Integrated backup


<h4>Advantages of self managed db compated to Cloud SQL</h4>

More flexibility with the config options

Maintenance cost is probably lower especially with the small projects

Easier to keep lower level environments identical with PROD

Easier to move to another cloud provider  ... or back to on-premise :-)

Moving to another cloud provider is straightforward


<h4>Question marks: scaling</h4>
