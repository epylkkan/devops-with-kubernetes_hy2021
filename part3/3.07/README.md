<h2>PREFERRED DB FOR THIS TRAINING</h2>

In this training I keep using PostgreSQL in GKE containers with PersistentVolumeClaims.  There is no real benefit to use managed services for small apps where security / patching, backup, GCP Operations Suite 
integrations, high availability etc. aspects do not play a role.
